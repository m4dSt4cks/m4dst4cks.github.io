# About Me

Hey, my name is John Johnson and I am currently a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University. I earned bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Computer and Network Security from the United States Air Force Academy in 2018. I spend most of my time playing CTFs and researching topics like web application testing, Google's V8, and Microsft Windows internals.
